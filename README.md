# How to play

1. **Objective of the Game:** The main objective of Scrabble is to achieve the highest score by forming words on the game board.

2. **Number of Players:** Scrabble is played with 2 to 4 players, and each player receives a letter rack and a set of letter tiles.

3. **The Game Board:** The game is played on a gridded board consisting of special squares, some of which offer score bonuses.

4. **Word Formation:** Players must form words on the board using letter tiles.

5. **Scoring:** Each tile has a point value, and words are scored by adding up the values of all the letters used. Bonus squares multiply the points of individual letters or the entire word.

6. **Starting the Game:** The player who starts places a word in the center of the board. Subsequently, players take turns forming words.

7. **Drawing and Replenishing Tiles:** After each turn, players draw letter tiles from the general set and replenish their letter rack to have a total of seven tiles.

8. **Game End:** The game continues until the letter tiles in the general set are exhausted, a player has used all their tiles, or no more valid plays can be made.

9. **Final Scoring:** At the end of the game, the points of the unused tiles on each player's rack are subtracted from their total score. The player with the highest score wins.

10. **Specific Rules:** Additional rules, such as challenging incorrect words and restrictions on tile placement in certain squares, may apply depending on the version and rules agreed upon by the players.
